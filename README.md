## How to open an Obsisian vault locally
### Download and install Obsidian
https://help.obsidian.md/install
### Open the vault
1. pull this repo https://github.com/anastasiiabut/dev-doc.git
2. open Obsidian > click on Open folder as vault > select the folder where you pulled the repo
### Make a few changes and push them to the repo
Obsidian has a nice [documentation](https://help.obsidian.md/). 

While playing with it, I reccomend trying some things from [Editing&Formatting](https://help.obsidian.md/syntax)
