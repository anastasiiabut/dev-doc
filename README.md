## How to open an Obsisian vault locally
### Download and install Obsidian
https://help.obsidian.md/install
### Open the vault
1. pull this repo 
A vault is a folder on your local file system where Obsidian stores your notes.

The first time you open Obsidian, you'll be asked to add a new vault. You have two options, either create a new empty vault, or use an existing folder.

Open existing folder

If you already have a folder that you want to use as your vault:

    To the right of Open folder as vault, click Open.
    In the file browser, select the folder you want to use as your vault.
    Click Open.
